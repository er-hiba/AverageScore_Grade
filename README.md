## Description 
This program calculates the average of three input scores, validates them within the range of 0 to 20, and assigns a grade based on the calculated average. After calculation, it displays both the average score and its corresponding grade:
- "Excellent" if the average score is 16 or above
- "Good" if the average score is between 14 and 16 (including 14)
- "Fair" if the average score is between 12 and 14 (including 12)
- "Poor" if the average score is between 10 and 12 (including 10)
- "Very poor" if the average score is below 10
